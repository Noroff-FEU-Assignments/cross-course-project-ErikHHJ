    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>[It is important to secure your website from attacks just like you would install an alarm in your house. The most common web security threats are Cross-site scripting, SQL injections, and Cross-site request forgeries. The best tips are: Sanitize your data so the system only accepts the right format of data. Use a complicated and well known authentication service. Continuous Deployment, to catch oversights from developers before they become a problem, by flagging bits of code for a rework. This prevents bad code from slipping into the live version of the site. Protect the exchange of packets of data between the different nodes in the network. And lastly, always use automatic user timeout. Although this is mostly back end, it is important to note that websites have automatic timeout so hackers cant get to sensitive information of someone who is idle on the website]</p>
